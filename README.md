### Technical Test Requirements
As you know, we make payments on behalf of our clients. We like to be able to display the payment details in a clear, concise manner for our employees, who are responsible for ensuring the vendors receive the payments.

Attached is a blob of json data that represents the following: There are multiple vendors ("Payee") who will be paid using payment cards ("Payment"), with the associated invoices attached to each payment ("Remittance").

There is only one requirement - create a webpage that shows each Payee/Payment/Remittance object in a paged interface. Everything else is up to you - overall design, technology used, styling, amount of time spent on the test, etc.

Upload your sample to a private Github account or email to hr@paymerang.com  

## Test Results
Technical test achieved using React Native and React.JS

Fully functioning search bar to type in a selection or scroll down to find the client you are looking for. Search function for convienence due to the fact clients can be numerous and scrolling through a long list can be too tedious and time consuming. Styling simplified with reactstrap. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
